/*

This program is used for removing all the comments in a program code.

Example 1:
Input:
source = ["/*Test program */", "int main()", "{ ", "  // variable declaration ", "int a, b, c;", "/* This is a test", "   multiline  ", "   comment for ", "   testing */", "a = b + c;", "}"]

The line by line code is visualized as below:

/*Test program */
int main()
{
  // variable declaration
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline
   comment for
   testing */
a = b + c;
}

Output: ["int main()","{ ","  ","int a, b, c;","a = b + c;","}"]

The line by line code is visualized as below:

int main()
{

int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}

Explanation:
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.

Example 2:

Input:
source = ["a/*comment", "line", "more_comment*/b"]

Output: ["ab"]

Explanation:
The original source string is "a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b", where we have bolded the newline characters.
After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string "ab", which when delimited by newline characters becomes ["ab"].


Note:

The length of source is in the range [1, 100].
The length of source[i] is in the range [0, 80].
Every open block comment is eventually closed.
There are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.
